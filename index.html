            <p>
              I am currently 24 years old and I
              study multi media design at EK
              (formerly KEA) and I am currently in
              my third semester. I have been
              working with design, in my free time
              and during my education since I was
              in HTX and graduated in 2021.
              Outside of my studies, I like to
              work with graphic design, editing
              photos and videos for content
              creation, I am very much an
              organizer, so I work with lists and
              I like to structure work related
              things. I am also very creative and
              very imaginative, and I like to
              bring these imaginations onto
              something visual. I have an intuos
              tablet that I use for sketching
              designs, such as logos, icons and
              story boards. But there are many
              more things I am good at. Take a
              look below.

            <p>
              I have been learning HTML and CSS
              since my time in HTX. I primarily
              got my skills while studying at EK
              but I learned very fast and now I am
              able to make basic web pages without
              issues. I am able to read layout
              diagrams and wireframes in order to
              create the desired structure of
              websites, as well as styling them
              based on prototypes and mockups.

              also learned a lot at EK and I can
              use and understand the fundamentals
              of Javascript and I have created
              several websites where I use
              Javascript to create dynamic lists
              of products using APIs

            <p>
              During our second semester of multi
              media design, we were taught Astro.
              It took around a week of using it in
              practice to understand how it worked
              and I have been using it ever since
              to create less cluttered workspaces,
              to easily create web components and
              build more optimized websites.

              learned to properly utilize

              I am well exercised in using

              also very quick at learning new
              programs and new features when using
              these programs, so I wonâ€™t have

              teams. I have used it ever since to
              create workspaces for discovering,

              Throughout my studies, both here at
              EK, but also at HTX and previously
              at DTU, I have been using GIT and
              Github for project management and
              version control. I know the
              fundamentals of using GIT to create
              repositories, make feature branches
              and working in them. I have a good
              grasp on using GIT commands as well.

              Before I could afford the adobe
              creative cloud apps, I went outside
              the box and found alternatives that
              were open source. For editing
              photos, I used GIMP, which is very
              limited compared to photoshop, but I
              made it work because I was stubborn
              and using different user made
              plugins. I also used a free version
              of Davinci Resolve to edit videos.

            <p>
              At HTX we were given our own
              WordPress page which we could
              customize and use as our portfolio
              for our different projects. During
              that time I managed to learn how to
              use some of the templates and
              customize to my liking. There is
              still a lot more to learn but I can
              take on the challenge because of my
              basic knowledge so far.

            where my help is very much needed, for
            example in case of tough work
